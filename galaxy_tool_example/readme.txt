This example creates a basic galaxy tool.

It takes two plain text inputs from the two textbox fields on the galaxy webform, calls a python script (thello.py) with the two inputs as command line arguments and redirects the output to galaxy's output.

For example, on the galaxy web interface if we put:
First Parameter Name="a b c"
Another Parameter="d e f"
The output will be:
["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]


Try it yourself - Deployment:
We define the directory with run.sh to be galaxy's BASEDIR.
And put the files to:
"BASEDIR/config/tool_conf.xml"
"BASEDIR/tools/mytools/hellot.xml"
"BASEDIR/tools/mytools/thello.py"


Most of the details are defined in hellot.xml:
It defines two textbox params named "input" and "input2"
And calls python as "python thello.py $input $input2 > $output"
The output actually will be replaced by a temp file path generated by galaxy and galaxy will read the file's value and display it on its web interface.

For the above example, when you click execute, galaxy actually runs the following command:
python thello.py "a b c" "d e f" > "/tmp/galaxy/083611.tmp"
And once our script completes running, galaxy reads "/tmp/galaxy/083611.tmp" and display its content on the web interface.
